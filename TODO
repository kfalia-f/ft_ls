check permissions when try to open a file (ft_with_args has prototype almost for that). + -R, -l.


-d with -l

-l with current dir, but without specifying '.'

AFTER MERGE. To implement -g flag I need -l flag.

!!!!koparker: print_colorized can't work with columns cause it gets 'head' as arg and not a 'char **' elem. But, I need these permissions info stored in list. Solutions:
*a*: new malloced char array for permissions corresponding names.
*b*: ???

so, we can partially tresh last commits of mine
